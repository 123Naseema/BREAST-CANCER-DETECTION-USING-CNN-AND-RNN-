**Breast cancer detection using CNN and RNN**

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for breast cancer detection using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. 
The proposed system aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection by leveraging the strengths of both CNNs and RNNs in analyzing medical imaging data.The CNN component of the hybrid model is designed to extract meaningful features from mammogram images, which are commonly used in breast cancer screening. 
The RNN component then processes the extracted features over time to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the data. This hybrid architecture allows the model to effectively utilize both spatial and temporal information, leading to more accurate and reliable detection of breast cancer
Key contributions of this work include the development of a hybrid CNN-RNN architecture specifically tailored for breast cancer detection and the evaluation of the proposed system on a large dataset of mammogram images. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms traditional CNN and RNN models in terms of accuracy and efficiency,
highlighting its potential for improving breast cancer detection in clinical settings.

Breast cancer detection has improved with the use of advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and RNN Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. 
CNNs are great at analyzing medical images like mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs, helping to find patterns that might indicate tumors or abnormalities.
LSTMs are good at looking at data over time, which is useful for tracking how a tumor changes or grows. By combining these two methods, CNNs can detect important features in images, while LSTMs can track how a patient's condition changes over time.
LSTMs use gates to control the flow of information. 
These gates help LSTMs selectively retain or discard information as needed. 
LSTMs can process entire sequences of data, not just individual data points. 
LSTMs are designed to effectively process and retain information over multiple time steps. 
 This combination improves accuracy in detecting breast cancer, reduces mistakes in diagnosis, and helps detect cancer earlier. It also allows e and personalized treatment plans. doctors to monitor tumor development in real-time, leading to more accurate![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b217b594-2e45-4781-9c9b-3bd50a094b13)
**INTRODUCTION**
**Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women, and timely detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival.
Challenges in Traditional Method: Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on manual interpretation of medical images, which can be subjective, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
Capabilities of CNNs: CNNs have proven to be highly effective in analyzing medical images such as mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs by identifying subtle patterns and features that may not be immediately visible to the human eye. This makes them ideal for detecting abnormalities and early signs of cancer.

**DEEPLEARNING**
Deep learning is a part of machine learning ,that use neural networks to learn from data. 
Types of Deep learning 
Conventional Neural Network(CNN): Mainly used for image related task
Eg: object recognition ,face detection
Recurrent Neural Network(RNN): It is one of the sequential data 
Text to voice generator or voice to Text generator
Eg: Speech recognition
Artificial Neural Network(ANN)I:
 It is one type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain

**Machine learning:**
Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and model that allow computer to learn from data and improve their performance
There are 3 types
1.Supervised learning:
the modelis trained on lable data ,lable data means input and output both can taken by the user
Eg:predicating house prices based on locations
2.Unsupervised learning :
the model is trained on unlabled data. unlabled data means we give input 
Eg: chatgpt,facebook,amazon etc
3.Reinforcement :learn from mistake
Eg: online chessboard,online games ,chatGpt
